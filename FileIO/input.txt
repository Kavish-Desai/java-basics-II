The determined value of the property is used to calculate the annual tax collected by the municipality or any other government entity upon the property owner. Ad valorem taxes are based on real property ownership and can therefore be compared with transaction taxes.  Ad valorem tax is determined and collected every year, while transaction tax is only levied at the time of transaction.
